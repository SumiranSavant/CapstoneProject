"Would you recommend a location in New Delhi to open a new cinema?"
My boss, the stakeholder wants to open a new cinema in New Delhi as company's new business.

 He explains that watching movie is a part of whole afternoon or night activities. Cinemas should have many restaurants and shopping places nearby. Transportation is also an important factor. Customers should be able to walk into cinema within 5 minutes from public transport.
It should also be at such a point where people dont have any hassle in parking and should be able to come without any hesitation 
He wants me to concentrate on selection of cinema location according to its nearby environment. Cinema facility and rental price is not the concern. He lists out his top 10 favorite cinemas in New Delhi.
